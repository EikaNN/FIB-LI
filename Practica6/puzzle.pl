The SEND + MORE = MONEY cryptoarithmetic puzzle is a classic "hello world" for constraint programming. The puzzle is to assign the digits 0 thru 9 to letters such that they spell out SEND MORE MONEY and when read as base 10 numbers create a true mathematical formula. Leading zeros are not permitted on numbers.
