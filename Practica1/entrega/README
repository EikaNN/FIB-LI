In this directory there are all necessary files to execute SAT solver.
There are auxiliary files such as picoSAT.txt, parse.py, random3SAT which are used by the script.

To execute, simply run test script. It needs 2 parameters:
	- executable file
	- file_id (symbol appended at the end of each generated filename, to avoid overriding files when doing a new test) 

For example: ./test.sh mySAT.exe 1

This script will show information while executing and will generate 3 files:
	- resum<file_id>.txt: for each test, show all information about mySAT
	- resultats<file_id>.txt: for each test show its solution
	- taula<file_id>.csv: table with all information about both mySAT and picosat

There is already a sample of those 3 files, generated in FIB.
