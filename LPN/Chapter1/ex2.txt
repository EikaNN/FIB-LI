Exercise 1.2 
Which of the following sequences of characters are atoms, which are variables,
which are complex terms, and which are not terms at all? Give the functor and
arity of each complex term.

1. loves(Vincent,mia) 				-> complex term, loves/2
2. ’loves(Vincent,mia)’ 			-> atom
3. Butch(boxer) 					-> not term
4. boxer(Butch) 					-> complex term, boxer/1
5. and(big(burger),kahuna(burger)) 	-> complex term and/1, big/1, kahuna/1
6. and(big(X),kahuna(X))			-> complex term and/1, big/1, kahuna/1
7. _and(big(X),kahuna(X)) 			-> not term
8. (Butch kills Vincent) 			-> not term
9. kills(Butch Vincent) 			-> not term
10. kills(Butch,Vincent 			-> not term
